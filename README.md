## Overview

This project explores progress toward **Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7)**: *Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.*

Access to electricity is foundational for development yet over **700 million people** still live without it. Using global data, I analyzed access, inequality, and renewable progress across regions.

## Business & Social Questions Answered

- Which countries and regions have the **lowest access to clean electricity**?
- How has **renewable energy usage** changed over the last decade?
- What regions are showing the **most improvement** in solar or off-grid access?
- How is energy access linked to **GDP, geography, and urbanization**?
- What are the key **policy gaps** based on access trends?

---

## Key Insights

- **Sub-Saharan Africa** remains the region with the lowest electrification rates, especially in rural zones.
- Countries like **Bangladesh, Kenya, and India** have made surprising gains through solar and microgrid investment.
- Progress in **urban areas** far exceeds rural pointing to a growing infrastructure divide.
- In some regions, renewable energy adoption is declining due to policy rollbacks or economic instability.
